Now that we have learned some about concurrency with Tokio, let's apply this on
the client side. Say we want to run two concurrent Redis commands. We can spawn
one task per command. Then the two commands would happen concurrently.

At first, we might try something like:

```rust,compile_fail
use mini_redis::client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Establish a connection to the server
    let mut client = client::connect("127.0.0.1:6379").await.unwrap();

    // Spawn two tasks, one gets a key, the other sets a key
    let t1 = tokio::spawn(async {
        let res = client.get("hello").await;
    });

    let t2 = tokio::spawn(async {
        client.set("foo", "bar".into()).await;
    });

    t1.await.unwrap();
    t2.await.unwrap();
}
```

This does not compile because both tasks need to access the `client` somehow.
As `Client` does not implement `Copy`, it will not compile without some code to
facilitate this sharing. Additionally, `Client::set` takes `&mut self`, which
means that exclusive access is required to call it. We could open a connection
per task, but that is not ideal. We cannot use `std::sync::Mutex` as `.await`
would need to be called with the lock held. We could use `tokio::sync::Mutex`,
but that would only allow a single in-flight request. If the client implements
[pipelining], an async mutex results in underutilizing the connection.

# Message passing

The answer is to use message passing. The pattern involves spawning a dedicated
task to manage the `client` resource. Any task that wishes to issue a request
sends a message to the `client` task. The `client` task issues the request on
behalf of the sender, and the response is sent back to the sender.

Using this strategy, a single connection is established. The task managing the
`client` is able to get exclusive access in order to call `get` and `set`.
Additionally, the channel works as a buffer. Operations may be sent to the
`client` task while the `client` task is busy. Once the `client` task is
available to process new requests, it pulls the next request from the channel.
This can result in better throughput, and be extended to support connection
pooling.

# Tokio's channel primitives

Tokio provides a [number of channels][channels], each serving a different purpose.

- [mpsc]: multi-producer, single-consumer channel. Many values can be sent.
- [oneshot]: single-producer, single consumer channel. A single value can be sent.
- [broadcast]: multi-producer, multi-consumer. Many values can be send. Each
  receiver sees every value.
- [watch]: single-producer, multi-consumer. Many values can be sent, but no
  history is kept. Receivers only see the most recent value.

If you need a multi-producer multi-consumer channel where only one consumer sees
each message, you can use the [`async-channel`] crate. There are also channels
for use outside of asynchronous Rust, such as [`std::sync::mpsc`] and
[`crossbeam::channel`]. These channels wait for messages by blocking the
thread, which is not allowed in asynchronous code.

In this section, we will use [mpsc] and [oneshot]. The other types of message
passing channels are explored in later sections. The full code from this section
is found [here][full].

# Define the message type

In most cases, when using message passing, the task receiving the messages
responds to more than one command. In our case, the task will respond to `GET` and
`SET` commands. To model this, we first define a `Command` enum and include a
variant for each command type.

```rust
use bytes::Bytes;

#[derive(Debug)]
enum Command {
    Get {
        key: String,
    },
    Set {
        key: String,
        val: Bytes,
    }
}
```

# Create the channel

In the `main` function, an `mpsc` channel is created.

```rust
use tokio::sync::mpsc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create a new channel with a capacity of at most 32.
    let (mut tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel(32);
# tx.send(()).await.unwrap();

    // ... Rest comes here
}
```

The `mpsc` channel is used to **send** commands to the task managing the redis
connection. The multi-producer capability allows messages to be sent from many
tasks. Creating the channel returns two values, a sender and a receiver. The two
handles are used separately. They may be moved to different tasks.

The channel is created with a capacity of 32. If messages are sent faster than
they are received, the channel will store them. Once the 32 messages are stored
in the channel, calling `send(...).await` will go to sleep until a message has
been removed by the receiver.

Sending from multiple tasks is done by **cloning** the `Sender`. For example:

```rust
use tokio::sync::mpsc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let (mut tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel(32);
    let mut tx2 = tx.clone();

    tokio::spawn(async move {
        tx.send("sending from first handle").await;
    });

    tokio::spawn(async move {
        tx2.send("sending from second handle").await;
    });

    while let Some(message) = rx.recv().await {
        println!("GOT = {}", message);
    }
}
```

Both messages are sent to the single `Receiver` handle. It is not possible to
clone the receiver of an `mpsc` channel.

When every `Sender` has gone out of scope or has otherwise been dropped, it is
no longer possible to send more messages into the channel. At this point, the
`recv` call on the `Receiver` will return `None`, which means that all senders
are gone and the channel is closed.

In our case of a task that manages the Redis connection, it knows that it
can close the Redis connection once the channel is closed, as the connection
will not be used again.

# Spawn manager task

Next, spawn a task that processes messages from the channel. First, a client
connection is established to Redis. Then, received commands are issued via the
Redis connection.

```rust
use mini_redis::client;
# enum Command {
#    Get { key: String },
#    Set { key: String, val: bytes::Bytes }
# }
# async fn dox() {
# let (_, mut rx) = tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(10);
// The `move` keyword is used to **move** ownership of `rx` into the task.
let manager = tokio::spawn(async move {
    // Establish a connection to the server
    let mut client = client::connect("127.0.0.1:6379").await.unwrap();

    // Start receiving messages
    while let Some(cmd) = rx.recv().await {
        use Command::*;

        match cmd {
            Get { key } => {
                client.get(&key).await;
            }
            Set { key, val } => {
                client.set(&key, val).await;
            }
        }
    }
});
# }
```

Now, update the two tasks to send commands over the channel instead of issuing
them directly on the Redis connection.

```rust
# #[derive(Debug)]
# enum Command {
#    Get { key: String },
#    Set { key: String, val: bytes::Bytes }
# }
# async fn dox() {
# let (mut tx, _) = tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(10);
// The `Sender` handles are moved into the tasks. As there are two
// tasks, we need a second `Sender`.
let mut tx2 = tx.clone();

// Spawn two tasks, one gets a key, the other sets a key
let t1 = tokio::spawn(async move {
    let cmd = Command::Get {
        key: "hello".to_string(),
    };

    tx.send(cmd).await.unwrap();
});

let t2 = tokio::spawn(async move {
    let cmd = Command::Set {
        key: "foo".to_string(),
        val: "bar".into(),
    };

    tx2.send(cmd).await.unwrap();
});
# }
````

At the bottom of the `main` function, we `.await` the join handles to ensure the
commands fully complete before the process exits.

```rust
# type Jh = tokio::task::JoinHandle<()>;
# async fn dox(t1: Jh, t2: Jh, manager: Jh) {
t1.await.unwrap();
t2.await.unwrap();
manager.await.unwrap();
# }
```

# Receive responses

The final step is to receive the response back from the manager task. The `GET`
command needs to get the value and the `SET` command needs to know if the
operation completed successfully.

To pass the response, an `oneshot` channel is used. The `oneshot` channel is a
single-producer, single-consumer channel optimized for sending a single value.
In our case, the single value is the response.

Similar to `mpsc`, `oneshot::channel()` returns a sender and receiver handle.

```rust
use tokio::sync::oneshot;

# async fn dox() {
let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();
# tx.send(()).unwrap();
# }
```

Unlike `mpsc`, no capacity is specified as the capacity is always one.
Additionally, neither handle can be cloned.

To receive responses from the manager task, before sending a command, an `oneshot`
channel is created. The `Sender` half of the channel is included in the command
to the manager task. The receive half is used to receive the response.

First, update `Command` to include the `Sender`. For convenience, a type alias
is used to reference the `Sender`.

```rust
use tokio::sync::oneshot;
use bytes::Bytes;

/// Multiple different commands are multiplexed over a single channel.
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Command {
    Get {
        key: String,
        resp: Responder<Option<Bytes>>,
    },
    Set {
        key: String,
        val: Vec<u8>,
        resp: Responder<()>,
    },
}

/// Provided by the requester and used by the manager task to send
/// the command response back to the requester.
type Responder<T> = oneshot::Sender<mini_redis::Result<T>>;
```

Now, update the tasks issuing the commands to include the `oneshot::Sender`.

```rust
# use tokio::sync::{oneshot, mpsc};
# #[derive(Debug)]
# enum Command {
#     Get { key: String, resp: Responder<Option<bytes::Bytes>> },
#     Set { key: String, val: Vec<u8>, resp: Responder<()> },
# }
# type Responder<T> = oneshot::Sender<mini_redis::Result<T>>;
# fn dox() {
# let (mut tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel(10);
# let mut tx2 = tx.clone();
let t1 = tokio::spawn(async move {
    let (resp_tx, resp_rx) = oneshot::channel();
    let cmd = Command::Get {
        key: "hello".to_string(),
        resp: resp_tx,
    };

    // Send the GET request
    tx.send(cmd).await.unwrap();

    // Await the response
    let res = resp_rx.await;
    println!("GOT = {:?}", res);
});

let t2 = tokio::spawn(async move {
    let (resp_tx, resp_rx) = oneshot::channel();
    let cmd = Command::Set {
        key: "foo".to_string(),
        val: b"bar".to_vec(),
        resp: resp_tx,
    };

    // Send the SET request
    tx2.send(cmd).await.unwrap();

    // Await the response
    let res = resp_rx.await;
    println!("GOT = {:?}", res)
});
# }
```

Finally, update the manager task to send the response over the `oneshot` channel.

```rust
# use tokio::sync::{oneshot, mpsc};
# #[derive(Debug)]
# enum Command {
#     Get { key: String, resp: Responder<Option<bytes::Bytes>> },
#     Set { key: String, val: Vec<u8>, resp: Responder<()> },
# }
# type Responder<T> = oneshot::Sender<mini_redis::Result<T>>;
# async fn dox(mut client: mini_redis::client::Client) {
# let (_, mut rx) = mpsc::channel::<Command>(10);
while let Some(cmd) = rx.recv().await {
    match cmd {
        Command::Get { key, resp } => {
            let res = client.get(&key).await;
            // Ignore errors
            let _ = resp.send(res);
        }
        Command::Set { key, val, resp } => {
            let res = client.set(&key, val.into()).await;
            // Ignore errors
            let _ = resp.send(res);
        }
    }
}
# }
```

Calling `send` on `oneshot::Sender` completes immediately and does **not**
require an `.await`. This is because `send` on an `oneshot` channel will always
fail or succeed immediately without any form of waiting.

Sending a value on a oneshot channel returns `Err` when the receiver half has
dropped. This indicates the receiver is no longer interested in the response. In
our scenario, the receiver cancelling interest is an acceptable event. The `Err`
returned by `resp.send(...)` does not need to be handled.

You can find the entire code [here][full].

# Backpressure and bounded channels

Whenever concurrency or queuing is introduced, it is important to ensure that the
queueing is bounded and the system will gracefully handle load. Unbounded queues
will eventually fill up all available memory and cause the system to fail in
unpredictable ways.

Tokio takes care to avoid implicit queuing. A big part of this is the fact that
async operations are lazy. Consider the following:

```rust
# fn async_op() {}
# fn dox() {
loop {
    async_op();
}
# }
# fn main() {}
```

If the asynchronous operation runs eagerly, the loop will repeatedly queue a new
`async_op` to run without ensuring the previous operation completed. This
results in implicit unbounded queuing. Callback based systems and **eager**
future based systems are particularly susceptible to this.

However, with Tokio and asynchronous Rust, the above snippet will **not** result
in `async_op` running at all. This is because `.await` is never called. If the
snippet is updated to use `.await`, then the loop waits for the operation to
complete before starting over.

```rust
# async fn async_op() {}
# async fn dox() {
loop {
    // Will not repeat until `async_op` completes
    async_op().await;
}
# }
# fn main() {}
```

Concurrency and queuing must be explicitly introduced. Ways to do this include:

* `tokio::spawn`
* `select!`
* `join!`
* `mpsc::channel`

When doing so, take care to ensure total amount of concurrency is bounded. For
example, when writing a TCP accept loop, ensure that the total number of open
sockets is bounded. When using `mpsc::channel`, pick a manageable channel
capacity. Specific bound values will be application specific.

Taking care and picking good bounds is a big part of writing reliable Tokio applications.
