This tutorial will take you step by step through the process of building a
[Redis] client and server. We will start with the basics of asynchronous
programing with Rust and build up from there. We will implement a subset of
Redis commands but will get a comprehensive tour of Tokio.

# Mini-Redis

The project that you will build in this tutorial is available as [Mini-Redis on
GitHub][mini-redis]. Mini-Redis is designed with the primary goal of learning
Tokio, and is therefore very well commented, but this also means that Mini-Redis
is missing some features you would want in a real Redis library. You can find
production-ready Redis libraries on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

We will use Mini-Redis directly in the tutorial. This allows us to use parts of
Mini-Redis in the tutorial before we implement them later in the tutorial.

# Getting Help

At any point, if you get stuck, you can always get help on [Discord] or [GitHub
discussions][disc]. Don't worry about asking "beginner" questions. We all start
somewhere and are happy to help.

# Prerequisites

Readers should already be familiar with [Rust]. The [Rust book][book] is an
excellent resource to get started with.

While not required, some experience with writing networking code using the [Rust
standard library][std] or another language can be helpful.

No pre-existing knowledge of Redis is required.

## Rust

Before getting started, you should make sure that you have the
[Rust][install-rust] toolchain installed and ready to go. If you don't have it,
the easiest way to install it is using [rustup].

This tutorial requires a minimum of Rust version `1.45.0`, but the most
recent stable version of Rust is recommended.

To check that Rust is installed on your computer, run the following:

```bash
$ rustc --version
```

You should see output like `rustc 1.46.0 (04488afe3 2020-08-24)`.

## Mini-Redis server

Next, install the Mini-Redis server. This will be used to test our client as we
build it.

```bash
$ cargo install mini-redis
```

Make sure that it was successfully installed by starting the server:

```bash
$ mini-redis-server
```

Then try to get the key `foo` using `mini-redis-cli`

```bash
$ mini-redis-cli get foo
```

You should see `(nil)`.

# Ready to go

That's it, everything is ready to go. Go to the next page to write your first
asynchronous Rust application.
