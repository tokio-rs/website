The Tokio community is most readily found on
[its gitter channel](https://gitter.im/tokio-rs/tokio), where you're welcome to
ask questions, report problems, or pitch ideas.

Github is used for tracking issues.

We also have an issue tracker on the main [Tokio
repository](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues)

If you're a Tokio user, you're highly encouraged to keep an eye on these issues
and jump in on the discussions, to help us understand how design tradeoffs might
affect you.

These repositories also contain milestones for upcoming *major* releases, which
are currently used to track breaking changes that might be considered for the
next major release.
