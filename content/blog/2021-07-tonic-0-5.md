We are pleased to announce version 0.5 of [Tonic], a native gRPC implementation in
Rust. 0.5 is a big release and has been in the works for some time.

Some key new features are:

# gRPC-Web

[gRPC-Web] is a protocol that allows clients to connect to gRPC services over
HTTP/1.1, instead of the usual HTTP/2. A common use-case for gRPC-Web is
JavaScript clients running in the browser.

The new crate [tonic-web] allows regular Tonic servers to accept gRPC-Web
requests without the need of an external proxy.

Enabling gRPC-Web support is as easy as:

```rust
use tonic::transport::Server;
// code generated by tonic-build
use hello_world::greeter_server::{GreeterServer, Greeter};

struct MyGreeter;

#[tonic::async_trait]
impl Greeter for MyGreeter {
    // ...
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let addr = "0.0.0.0:3000".parse().unwrap();

    let greeter = GreeterServer::new(MyGreeter);

    // enable grpc-web support for our `greeter` service
    let service = tonic_web::enable(greeter);

    Server::builder()
        // by default tonic servers only accept http2 requests
        // so we have to enable receiving http1 as well
        .accept_http1(true)
        .add_service(service)
        .serve(addr)
        .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

For more details see the [tonic-web crate](https://crates.io/crates/tonic-web).

# Compression

Tonic can now transparently compress and decompression requests, responses, and
streams.

Enabling compression on a client is done like so:

```rust
let client = GreeterClient::new(channel)
    // compress requests
    .send_gzip()
    /// accept compressed responses
    .accept_gzip();
```

And like so on the server:

```rust
let service = GreeterServer::new(greeter)
    // accept compressed requests
    .accept_gzip()
    // compress responses, if supported by the client
    .send_gzip();
```

Note this requires enabling the `compression` feature on both tonic and
[tonic-build]. See the [docs][compression-docs] for more details.

# Improved Tower integration

Tonic has always had support for extending clients and servers through [Tower]
but in 0.5 the new [`Server::layer`] method makes it even easier. We can add
tracing and authorization to a service by using middleware from [tower-http]:

```rust
use tonic::transport::Server;
use tower_http::{
    auth::RequireAuthorizationLayer,
    trace::TraceLayer,
};

// The stack of middleware our service will be wrapped in
let layer = tower::ServiceBuilder::new()
    // High level tracing of requests and responses
    .layer(TraceLayer::new_for_grpc())
    // Authorize all requests using a token
    .layer(RequireAuthorizationLayer::bearer("my-secret-token"))
    // Convert our `ServiceBuilder` into a `tower::Layer`
    .into_inner();

Server::builder()
    // Apply our middleware stack to the server
    .layer(layer)
    .add_service(GreeterServer::new(MyGreeter)
    .serve(addr)
    .await?;
```

# More flexible interceptors

Interceptors are lightweight middleware that can, among other things, be used to
modify the meta data of incoming requests and optionally reject them with a
status.

Interceptors have always been fairly limited however. For example, you couldn't
combine multiple interceptors and would instead have to use Tower's [`Service`]
abstraction, which is more powerful but also requires more code to setup.

For 0.5 we have a new interceptor API that is as easy to use as before but now
uses Tower internally. That means interceptors can be applied in the same way as
any other Tower middleware. For example adding multiple interceptors to a client
is now possible with:

```rust
use tonic::{
  Request, Status,
  service::interceptor_fn,
  transport::Endpoint
};

fn intercept_one(req: Request<()>) -> Result<Request<()>, Status> {
    // ...
}

fn intercept_two(req: Request<()>) -> Result<Request<()>, Status> {
    // ...
}

let channel = Endpoint::from_static("http://[::1]:50051").connect_lazy()?;

let intercepted_channel = tower::ServiceBuilder::new()
    .layer(interceptor_fn(intercept_one))
    .layer(interceptor_fn(intercept_two))
    .service(channel);

let client = GreeterClient::new(intercepted_channel);
```

0.5 includes many other smaller features and improvements. The [changelog] has
all the details.

As always, if you have questions you can find us in `#tonic` in the [Tokio
Discord] server.
