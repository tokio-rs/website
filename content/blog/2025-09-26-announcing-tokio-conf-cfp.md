We are excited to announce that the Call for Speakers for TokioConf 2026 is
officially open!

As we announced in June, the Tokio project is hosting the inaugural TokioConf,
which will take place on April 20-22 in Portland, OR, and will gather 300
developers to exchange ideas, learn from one another, and explore the future of
async Rust. The conference focuses on the practical side of async Rust
development. Whether you've been working with async Rust for years and have
lessons to share, you're new to it and figuring out the patterns, or you're a
student preparing to start your first job, we want talks that help everyone who
uses async Rust in production.

[Submit a talk proposal here][sessionize].

We're looking for talks across all technical levels - every talk should provide
people with practical insights they can apply in their own work. Whether you're
sharing beginner lessons or advanced optimization tricks, focus on real
experiences and practical applications that people can actually use. . We are
especially interested in talks about:

<ins>Production Lessons:</ins><br/>
What actually happened when you shipped Tokio code to production - the outages,
the tough debugging sessions, the scaling surprises. What tools do you wish
you'd known about, and what would you do differently next time?

<ins>Architecture Patterns & Design:</ins><br/>
The architectural decisions that worked (and the ones that didn't) - actor
patterns, channels, when to spin up multiple runtimes, different concurrency
approaches, and when you probably shouldn't use Tokio at all.

<ins>Performance Optimization:</ins><br/>
Stories about hunting down that one blocking call that was tanking performance,
tuning runtimes, dealing with oversubscription, and annoying OS scheduling
pauses. Share the optimization tricks that actually made a difference.

<ins>Debugging & Monitoring:</ins><br/>
How do you actually figure out what's going wrong in async code, especially in
production? Share your debugging and monitoring setups that work.

<ins>Rust Everywhere:</ins><br/>
Can Rust really work everywhere, not just for high-performance systems? Real
experiences using async Rust for typical applications, what's working, what's
still missing, and what we'd need to get there.

<ins>Testing Async Code:</ins><br/>
How to actually test this stuff without pulling your hair out, catching those
sneaky cancellation bugs before they hit users, and the practices that help you
ship reliable async systems.

<ins>Team Adoption:</ins><br/>
The real story of adoption - what worked when convincing your team, the training
that actually helped, the failures and false starts, the common concerns and
roadblocks you hit, and how to build codebases that your whole team can work
with.

<ins>What's Next:</ins><br/>
Industry shifts and emerging technologies that will impact how we build async
applications. New paradigms, AI, evolving infrastructure - what's coming that
async Rust developers should be thinking about?

## How to Submit
Have something the community should hear about? We're accepting submissions
through December 8, 2025. Submit your proposal at
[https://sessionize.com/tokioconf-2026][sessionize]. We'll be making the final
decisions late January 2026.

Questions about your talk idea? Reach out to us at
[hello@tokioconf.com](hello@tokioconf.com) - we're happy to help you figure out
if your experience would make a great talk. There is also a #tokioconf channel
on the Tokio project [Discord], another good place to ask questions.

## What Happens Next
We are busy planning the conference and will be announcing more details over the
coming months. Sign up for email updates at
[tokioconf.com](https://tokioconf.com), or follow us on [Bluesky] or [Mastodon] to
get updates.

Looking forward to hearing what you've learned building with async Rust.
