We are pleased to announce the [1.0 release][ann] of Tokio, an asynchronous
runtime for the Rust programming language. Tokio provides the needed building
blocks for writing reliable networking applications without compromising speed.
It comes with asynchronous APIs for TCP, UDP, timers, a [multi-threaded,
work-stealing scheduler][sched], and more.

[ann]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/releases/tag/tokio-1.0.0

Over the years, we have been delighted watching our users build amazing things.
For example, [Discord] used Tokio to reduce tail latencies 5x. [Fly.io] found
that, with Tokio, they can effortlessly meet their performance requirements and
focus on delivering features to their customers. For [the Zcash Foundation], building on Tokio
enables them to design misuse-resistant APIs. For AWS, their [Lambda][lambda]
team used Tokio to implement more reliable and flexible services.

# A stability guarantee

We first [announced] Tokio over four years ago. Since then, it has evolved
significantly. The most notable change happened a year ago with the addition of
[async and await][async_await] to Rust. Today, Tokio is easier to use and more
powerful. This evolution has also caused some friction. It has required
libraries to track these changes, and could result in confusing error
messages when accidentally depending on multiple versions of Tokio.

The Tokio 1.0 release ends this churn. As part of the release, we are committing
to providing a stable foundation for the ecosystem. We have no current plans for
Tokio 2.0 and we commit to holding back on a Tokio 2.0 release for at least 3
years. We plan to maintain the Tokio 1.0 branch for a minimum of 5 years.
Tokio will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of 6
months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been released
at least six months ago.

This stability does not mean Tokio will stagnate. We still have a lot of
work to do.

# 2021

We expect to focus on a few areas this coming year: `Stream`, `io_uring`, tracing
integration, and the Tokio stack.

## `Stream`

Today, the [`tokio-stream`] crate provides asynchronous iteration utilities
based on the Stream trait. An [RFC] to move the [`Stream` trait][Stream] from
[`futures-core`] to the Rust standard library is pending approval.

Once the standard library provides the Stream trait, Tokio’s stream utilities
will move into the Tokio crate itself.

[RFC]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2996
[Stream]: https://docs.rs/futures-core/0.3/futures_core/stream/trait.Stream.html
[`futures-core`]: https://docs.rs/futures-core/

## `io_uring`

[`io_uring`] is a new Linux interface providing asynchronous operations for all
types of I/O, including disk, while reducing the required number of syscalls.
Currently, on Linux, Tokio uses the `epoll(7)` interface, which notoriously does not
work for disk access. To work around this, Tokio provides asynchronous
filesystem APIs by dispatching synchronous operations to a thread pool. While
this works, it is not optimal.

By leveraging `io_uring`, Tokio will be able to provide genuinely asynchronous
filesystem operations. Additionally, early benchmarks of `io_uring` are very
promising and we are hopeful that these performance improvements will carry over
to Tokio.

## `tracing`

Defining a first-class story around operating Tokio applications will be a focus
for 2021. A big part of this story will be tooling around tracing and metrics.
The [`tracing`] crate already provides much of the needed infrastructure. It
implements a facade layer and data model for structured diagnostics, allowing
both libraries and applications to emit machine-readable data that can be
consumed in a variety of ways.

Over the coming year, we will build deeper integration between tracing and the
rest of the Tokio stack. This integration will help provide the needed
visibility into Tokio's internals to answer questions. Questions like how you
can tune the Tokio runtime to reduce tail latencies, know what tasks are
currently running, or which locks are the most contended.

Furthermore, we will continue to improve and grow the rest of the `tracing`
ecosystem. This includes work towards new releases of the core `tracing` and
`tracing-core` crates, adding richer instrumentation to the libraries in the
Tokio stack, and providing integrations with other diagnostics and observability
tools, such as [`tracing-opentelemetry`].

## The Tokio stack

Tokio provides a runtime and asynchronous APIs for standard primitives such as
sockets and timers, but networking applications will often use higher-level
protocols such as HTTP and gRPC. The Tokio stack includes Hyper for HTTP and
Tonic for gRPC to address these needs. Today, we [released Hyper 0.14][hyperel]
with Tokio 1.0 support. Tonic will be updated shortly.

With Tokio 1.0 out the door, we will also focus on [Tower], a set of reusable
components for building reliable clients and servers.

# Thanks

Tokio would not be possible without our many contributors, especially [Alice
Ryhl][alice], who has been invaluable to the project. Thanks to the leaders of
the Tokio stack libraries: [Sean McArthur][sean] (Hyper), [Lucio Franco][lucio]
(Tonic), [Eliza Weisman][eliza] (Tracing), and [Thomas De Zeeuw][thomas] (Mio).
Also, Tokio would not have been possible without [Aaron Turon][aaron]'s and
[Alex Crichton][alex]'s early involvement.

Finally, a big thanks is due to the companies who have financially supported
Tokio: [Mozilla], [Dropbox], [Buoyant], and [AWS].
