We’re happy to announce the inaugural **TokioConf**, a dedicated conference for
developers building asynchronous network applications in Rust. It will be a
single-track event bringing together developers from many areas to talk about
how they use Tokio and Rust to build high-performance, reliable production
applications. Expect talks, panels, and time to share challenges and lessons
learned.

When: **April 20-22, 2026** <br/>
Where: **Portland, OR** <br/>
Website: [**tokioconf.com**](https://tokioconf.com) | [Mastodon] | [BlueSky]

## Why TokioConf?

More and more teams are using Rust and Tokio in production, and they’re all
tackling similar challenges—bringing Rust into existing systems, helping new
developers get up to speed, designing for reliability, and figuring out how to
test and deploy async code at scale. **TokioConf** is a space for those
conversations to swap ideas, learn from each other, and help the community
figure out where async Rust goes next.

## Be Part of It

We’ve got ideas for topics we’d love to see—debugging async code, instrumenting
production systems, or successfully introducing Rust at work. But for now,
**TokioConf is a blank canvas**, and we want to hear from *you*.

What talks would help you build faster, more reliable async applications? What
challenges are you facing? Let us know! Drop a comment on the Reddit thread, or
mention us on [Bluesky] or [Mastodon].

The **call for proposals (CFP)** is opening soon, and we can’t wait to hear your
ideas.

## Stay in the Loop

We’re so excited to bring the community together—see you in Portland next year!
